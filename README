DISCLAIMER:
I in no way encourage Music Piracy. I would hope that you use this in a good way for listening to music when you have no connection, not for pirating music. I am not responsible if the RIAA shows up at your door or if your Pandora account suddenly stops working, or any other damages caused by using this application. Please, just use common sense and there won't be a problem...
